# Security Guideline Document for Real Estate Knowledge Base

This document outlines the security guidelines and best practices that are integrated into the development lifecycle of the Real Estate Knowledge Base. The aim is to ensure that the system is secure, resilient, and trustworthy by design while leveraging various GCP services, Supabase, and third-party APIs.

## 1. Security by Design

*   **Early Consideration:** Security is embedded from the initial design through implementation, testing, and deployment. Every system component is evaluated for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Simplicity & Clarity:** Security controls are kept simple to avoid unnecessary complexity, ensuring easier maintenance and fewer chances of misconfigurations.

## 2. Least Privilege & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Role Definitions:** Distinct user roles (first-time home buyers, real estate investors, professionals, administrative users) are enforced using Google Cloud IAM and Supabaseâ€™s Row-Level Security.
*   **Minimal Permissions:** Each component, user, and service is granted only the permissions necessary to perform its tasks to minimize the exposure of sensitive information.

## 3. Defense in Depth

*   **Layered Security:** Multiple security layers are applied from the frontend (Next.js, Flutter) to the backend (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) and data storage (Supabase, Cloud Storage), ensuring that failure in one layer does not compromise the whole system.
*   **API Gateway:** Acts as a central entry point to enforce security policies, monitor, and throttle requests, protecting backend services from direct exposure.

## 4. Input Validation & Output Encoding

*   **Sanitization:** All external inputs from web, mobile apps, and API calls are treated as untrusted. Inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent injection, XSS, and other scripting attacks.
*   **Encoding:** Context-aware encoding is implemented in output streams, especially for user-facing data coming from the custom LLM responses.

## 5. Fail Securely

*   **Error Handling:** Proper error handling prevents sensitive information leakage. Errors are logged securely while generic error messages are returned on failure.
*   **Fallback Mechanisms:** Secure fallback procedures are established for handling unexpected failures in data ingestion, API processing, and document processing flows.

## 6. Secure Data Management & Privacy

*   **Encryption:** All sensitive real estate data is encrypted both in transit (using TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest (using industry-standard encryption such as AES-256).
*   **Data Segregation:** Data is organized into categories (Listings, Legal Documents, Property Images, Transaction Histories, and Area Statistics) with strict access permissions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to data protection standards (such as GDPR) is ensured through regular audits and secure configuration of storage solutions.

## 7. Authentication & Session Management

*   **Robust Authentication:** Uses secure user identification mechanisms along with strong password policies. Hashing (using Argon2/bcrypt with unique salts) is enforced for password storage.
*   **Session Security:** Secure session management is implemented using unpredictable session identifiers, session timeouts, and secure logout functionalities.

## 8. API & Service Security

*   **HTTPS Enforcement:** All API communications (via API Gateway) are secured with TLS encryption.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented on API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service and brute-force attacks.
*   **Proper HTTP Verbs:** API endpoints strictly enforce RESTful methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure only intended actions are allowed.

## 9. Secure Dependencies & Infrastructure

*   **Hardened Configurations:** GCP services (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, API Gateway) and third-party systems (Supabase) are configured with secure defaults and regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Least Exposure:** Only necessary ports and services are exposed. Default credentials are replaced and file permissions are strictly managed.

## 10. Secure Integration of AI/ML Components

*   **Vertex AI Integration:** Custom LLMs are built with Vertex AI with strict key and token management. Inputs and outputs are validated to secure AI communications.
*   **Document Processing:** Integration with Document AI and Cloud Vision includes robust input checks for documents and images to prevent template injection and adversarial attacks.

## 11. Chatbot & Frontend Security

*   **Dialogflow CX:** Chatbot interactions are secured via API gateway routing. NLP inputs are validated, and sensitive interactions are processed without exposing underlying logic.
*   **Frontend Best Practices:** Next.js and Flutter apps implement secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite), Content Security Policies (CSP), and anti-CSRF tokens to safeguard against common web vulnerabilities.

## 12. Continuous Auditing and Updates

*   **Regular Security Audits:** System components are subject to continuous vulnerability assessments and compliance checks.
*   **Dependency Management:** Active scanning of third-party libraries and strict lockfile usage (e.g., package-lock.json, yarn.lock) minimize potential risks from dependency updates.

## 13. Summary & Best Practices

*   Maintain a security-first mindset across all development stages.
*   Regularly update and patch all systems and dependencies.
*   Ensure clear documentation for all security procedures to allow for effective audits and maintenance.

Following these guidelines ensures that the Real Estate Knowledge Base remains secure, scalable, and robust, appropriately protecting both user and organizational data.

*For any uncertainties about implementation details or if additional security measures are needed, please flag for review prior to proceeding to production.*
