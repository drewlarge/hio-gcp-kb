# Real Estate Knowledge Base - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first discovers the real estate knowledge base, they are greeted by a clean, modern landing page that explains the purpose of the app and its main benefits. The user is offered clear options for signing up via email or through social login, which helps quickly identify whether they are a first-time home buyer, a real estate investor, or a professional like an agent or broker. After clicking on the sign-up link, the new user is led through a simple and secure registration process where they enter their credentials and choose their user role. Once registration is complete, the user may sign in immediately using a familiar login screen. Users who forget their password will find a secure “Forgot Password” option that guides them through verifying their identity and receiving a reset link. Additionally, any session lapse or time-out results in a smooth sign-out process with directions on how to log back in, maintaining the app’s focus on security and ease of use.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, users are taken to a personalized main dashboard that serves as the entry point for all functionalities. The home page is designed with a balanced and uncluttered layout that highlights key sections such as property listings, legal documents, property images, transaction histories, and area statistics. At the top, users may see a header that includes navigation menus for switching between various sections; a sidebar provides additional shortcuts to detailed reports or frequently used tools. The page is built using modern design principles that feature a neutral color palette with accents of blue, green, and orange, establishing an atmosphere of trust and professionalism. Users can quickly move to different parts of the app from the dashboard by clicking through intuitive links which lead them to either the full details of property information, document upload areas, or the interactive chatbot interface.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once inside the system, users can engage with two primary features: interacting with an advanced AI-driven query system and processing real estate documents. When a user wants to ask a question or needs detailed insights, they simply enter their query into a search bar located on the main dashboard of the web or mobile app. This query is then sent via a REST API managed by API Gateway, which in turn calls on Cloud Functions that communicate with the custom large language model powered by Vertex AI. The AI processes the question in real time and returns a clear and detailed answer. In a similar manner, when a user needs to upload or process documents, they click on a dedicated upload section which is available on both the dashboard and a separate document processing page. Here, users select files for upload and the documents are stored securely in Cloud Storage. Following this, services like Document AI and Cloud Vision automatically extract structured data and analyze images. Users are then directed to a results page where the processed data appears in an easy-to-read format, which can further inform their queries or decision-making. Advanced workflows and additional tools are offered to administrative users who need to manage data, control access, and update training models. The pages transition smoothly, ensuring that every action—from uploading files to receiving query responses—connects clearly to the next step without any gaps or confusing redirects.

## Settings and Account Management

For users looking to manage their profile or adjust personalized settings, a dedicated account management area is accessible from any page, usually through a profile icon or menu in the header. Here users can update personal details such as their email, password, and role-specific preferences. The interface is built in simple, clear language that guides even non-technical users in changing notification settings, language preferences, or linked social login information. Administrative users have additional tools available in the settings area to manage billing, subscription details, and even the permissions for other users. Once changes are made, the system confirms updates through a friendly notification and returns the user to their main dashboard, ensuring that account management tasks do not break the overall flow of the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The app has been designed to handle errors in a friendly and informative way. If a user enters incorrect information during sign-up or tries to access a page without proper permissions, clear error messages are displayed on the same screen with guidance on how to correct the error. For instance, when a query fails because of an invalid request, the app displays an explanation along with steps to resubmit the query. In cases where connectivity drops, the user is shown a fallback page with options to retry the action. Similarly, if uploaded documents do not meet the expected format because of issues with Document AI or Cloud Vision processing, the app directs users to a help page for troubleshooting. This consistent style of error handling guarantees that the user always knows what to do next, thereby minimizing frustration and ensuring a smooth recovery from potential issues.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the very first encounter on the landing page to engaging with advanced AI-driven functionalities, the app provides a complete and seamlessly connected journey. A new user first registers through a secure sign-up process, sets or confirms their precise role, and then explores personalized dashboards that show structured data related to real estate. The journey continues as users switch between querying the custom LLM and uploading documents for automated processing. With responsive page transitions, clear account management flows, and robust error messaging, every interaction is designed for clarity and ease. Whether checking property details, receiving smart insights from the LLM, or managing personal profiles, the app keeps its users informed and empowered through a well-orchestrated end-to-end experience built on modern cloud and AI technology.
