# Tech Stack Document

This document provides an overview of the technology choices for our Real Estate Knowledge Base project. It explains, in everyday language, how each component contributes to the project’s goals. The document is structured into sections, each explaining how the chosen technologies work together to deliver a robust, secure, and user-friendly experience.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is what our end-users interact with directly. For our project, it is important to have interfaces that are both attractive and easy to use. Here’s how we’ve built it:

*   **Next.js**

    *   Used for building the web application interface.
    *   Offers server-side rendering and static site generation, which helps pages load quickly and improves search engine visibility.
    *   Provides a modern, clean, and responsive design that makes it easy for first-time home buyers, real estate investors, and professionals to navigate.

*   **Flutter**

    *   Chosen for developing a cross-platform mobile app.
    *   Enables us to create consistent, seamless experiences across both iOS and Android devices.
    *   Ensures that users looking for real estate information get a smooth and engaging experience on the go.

The design approach aligns with current UI/UX trends using a neutral color palette with blue, green, and orange accents to communicate professionalism and trust. It also adheres to the provided guidelines for fonts and colors (e.g., Roboto for body text, Roboto Condensed for headers).

## Backend Technologies

The backend makes everything work behind the scenes – processing data, managing requests, and ensuring the right information is sent to users. Our backend includes several key components:

*   **Serverless Computing & API Management**

    *   **Cloud Functions** & **Cloud Run**: These handle business logic and processing tasks. They automatically scale based on demand, ensuring performance even during heavy usage.
    *   **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all API requests, directing them to the appropriate functions or services. This simplifies management and secures the API endpoints.

*   **Data Management & Storage**

    *   **Supabase**: Utilized for managing structured data. It provides a seamless, secure backend interface and supports our role-based access policies (using features like Row-Level Security).
    *   **Cloud Storage**: Used to store large volumes of documents and images, such as property listings, legal documents, and transaction records.

*   **AI and ML Integration**

    *   **Vertex AI**: Powers our custom large language model (LLM) which processes user queries and delivers detailed, personalized responses.
    *   **Document AI**: Processes and extracts structured data from uploaded documents like PDFs or scanned papers.
    *   **Cloud Vision**: Analyzes images (for example, property photos) for recognition and data extraction tasks.

By combining these technologies, the backend efficiently manages and processes the rich data required for the knowledge base, ensuring users always receive up-to-date and accurate information.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Having a reliable and scalable infrastructure underpins everything we do. Here’s how our deployment setup ensures our application runs smoothly:

*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

    *   The entire application is hosted on GCP, taking advantage of its reliability, security, and scalability.
    *   Services like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run automatically adjust resources based on demand, making it easier to handle varying loads.

*   **Deployment and Version Control**

    *   Although specific CI/CD tools are not directly mentioned, it is standard to integrate version control systems (like Git) and automated pipelines to maintain code quality and streamline deployments.

*   **Scalability & Redundancy**

    *   Auto-scaling features and load balancing ensure that the app remains responsive regardless of how many users are on the platform.

This infrastructure supports continuous deployment and routine updates, such as daily data imports and manual uploads, while keeping downtime to a minimum.

## Third-Party Integrations

To enhance functionality and accelerate development, our project utilizes a range of third-party integrations:

*   **Dialogflow CX**

    *   Provides the intelligence behind our chatbot, enabling natural and interactive communication with users. It processes user requests and then routes them to the appropriate backend services.

*   **Additional APIs for Enhanced Features**

    *   **Vision API**: Complements Cloud Vision with image labeling and optical character recognition (OCR).
    *   **BigQuery ML**: Enables advanced data analysis and intelligent contextual searches, providing deep insights for users.
    *   **Palm API**: Introduces generative AI responses, enhancing the natural language capabilities of our interactions.

*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro & Cursor IDE**

    *   These tools assist with complex coding decisions and problem-solving, ensuring our AI-powered code is efficient and robust.

These integrations bring specialized capabilities into the project, enabling advanced AI/ML features and a more interactive user experience.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Ensuring the security and speed of our app is essential, particularly when dealing with sensitive real estate data. Here’s how we meet these needs:

*   **Security Measures**

    *   **Google Cloud IAM**: Controls who has access to various resources on GCP, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
    *   **Supabase Row-Level Security**: Further restricts data access directly at the database level.
    *   **Encryption**: All data is protected both in transit (using technologies such as TLS) and at rest, safeguarding user information.
    *   Regular security audits and adherence to legal standards (like GDPR) protect data privacy and integrity.

*   **Performance Optimizations**

    *   **Caching & Auto-Scaling**: API Gateway boosts response times with caching strategies. Cloud Functions and Cloud Run ensure that processing power scales with demand.
    *   **Server-Side Rendering & Static Site Generation**: Employed in Next.js to optimize frontend performance, ensuring webpages load quickly and efficiently.
    *   **Load Balancing & Redundancy**: These details help manage peak usage periods and ensure high availability.

Together, these security and performance strategies create a robust and dependable environment for all transactions and user interactions.
