# Backend Structure Document

This document provides a clear, everyday language overview of the backend setup for the real estate knowledge base project. It explains how the backend is organized, the technology components used, and how everything works together to make the system scalable, secure, and reliable.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend is built using a modern, scalable, and secure architecture. Here’s how it is organized:

*   **Serverless Compute:** We use Cloud Functions and Cloud Run to host our backend logic. This means our services automatically scale up or down based on demand without manual intervention.
*   **Centralized API Management:** An API Gateway is in place to manage and route incoming API requests efficiently, ensuring that communication between the frontend and backend is streamlined.
*   **Integration with AI/ML Services:** The backend connects with several AI/ML services such as Vertex AI for our custom language model, Document AI for processing documents, and Cloud Vision for image analysis.
*   **Design Patterns and Frameworks:** We utilize best practices and serverless paradigms, meaning that each function or service is independent, making it easier to maintain and update pieces of our backend without affecting the whole system.

This architecture supports scalability because serverless computing adapts automatically to traffic, ensures maintainability through modular function design, and delivers high performance by leveraging auto-scaling and managed services.

## 2. Database Management

For data storage, we rely primarily on Supabase, which is known for its simplicity and robust functionality. Key points:

*   **Database Type:**

    *   SQL-based database provided by Supabase.

*   **Data Organization:**

    *   Data is structured into tables that house different pieces of our real estate information, such as property listings, legal documents, images, and transaction records.
    *   Daily updates are processed automatically, keeping the data current.

*   **Security Measures:**

    *   Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures that data access is controlled based on user roles and permissions.

This setup makes it straightforward to store, update, and retrieve data while keeping it secure and well-organized.

## 3. Database Schema

### Human Readable Format

Our SQL database schema is organized into several key tables:

*   **Listings Table:** Contains details about property listings such as address, price, features, etc.
*   **Legal Documents Table:** Stores information about legal documents related to properties, including document types, upload dates, and associated listing IDs.
*   **Property Images Table:** Holds image references and metadata for each property.
*   **Transactions Table:** Records information on transactions, including buyer, seller, and transaction details.
*   **User Roles Table:** Manages different types of users (e.g., buyers, agents, investors) and their specific access levels.

### SQL Database Schema (PostgreSQL Example)

Below is a simplified version of our SQL schema in PostgreSQL style:

• Listings

*   id (Primary Key)
*   address (Text)
*   price (Numeric)
*   features (Text)
*   created_at (Timestamp)

• Legal_Documents

*   id (Primary Key)
*   listing_id (Foreign Key to Listings)
*   document_type (Text)
*   file_url (Text)
*   uploaded_at (Timestamp)

• Property_Images

*   id (Primary Key)
*   listing_id (Foreign Key to Listings)
*   image_url (Text)
*   description (Text)
*   uploaded_at (Timestamp)

• Transactions

*   id (Primary Key)
*   listing_id (Foreign Key to Listings)
*   buyer_id (Foreign Key to Users)
*   seller_id (Foreign Key to Users)
*   transaction_date (Date)
*   amount (Numeric)

• Users

*   id (Primary Key)
*   name (Text)
*   email (Text, unique)
*   role (Text)
*   created_at (Timestamp)

This schema ensures all data is logically stored and easily accessible for quick queries and reports.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The APIs serve as the bridge between the frontend and the backend systems. Key aspects include:

*   **API Design:**

    *   RESTful API design, allowing standardized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

*   **Key Endpoints:**

    *   **Query Endpoint:** Allows users to send queries that are processed by Cloud Functions, which then interact with Vertex AI to generate responses.
    *   **Document Upload Endpoint:** Lets users upload documents to Cloud Storage, triggering processing via Document AI and Cloud Vision.
    *   **Data Access Endpoints:** Retrieve listings, transaction data, and other real estate information from Supabase.
    *   **Chatbot Integration Endpoint:** Connects with Dialogflow CX to handle natural language interactions, using data from various sources and AI responses.

These endpoints make sure that data flows correctly between your user interface and the backend, ensuring that each action is efficiently processed.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The choice of hosting is crucial for ensuring availability and performance. Our setup includes:

*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**

    *   Uses managed services like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run to handle backend logic.
    *   Supabase for SQL data storage and management, integrated into the GCP ecosystem.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** Managed services ensure uptime and support global availability.
    *   **Scalability:** Auto-scaling and serverless computing adjust resources on demand.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** You only pay for what you use, making it ideal for varied traffic volumes.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

The backend uses several infrastructure tools to enhance performance, reliability, and user experience:

*   **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic across various backend services to prevent overload.
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Employed at the API Gateway to speed up data retrieval and reduce load on backend services.
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Optimize content delivery, especially for static files and images stored in Cloud Storage.
*   **API Gateway:** Serves as the central point of entry for all API requests, routing them to the appropriate Cloud Functions or Cloud Run services.

These components work together to ensure that the system is both fast and reliable, even under heavy load.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a top priority in our backend. Several measures safeguard data and system integrity:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**

    *   Managed via Google Cloud IAM, ensuring only authorized users gain access to services.
    *   Supabase implements Row-Level Security to enforce role-based access on data.

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, protecting sensitive information.

*   **Regular Audits:** The system undergoes periodic security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

*   **Compliance:** Ensured adherence to GDPR and other relevant regulations, securing personal and sensitive data throughout the platform.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Maintaining a smooth-running backend is essential. Here’s how it’s done:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Google Cloud Monitoring keeps an eye on system performance, alerting us to any issues in real-time.
    *   Logging and error tracking are integrated across Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and API Gateway.

*   **Maintenance Strategies:**

    *   Regular updates and patches are applied to all components to keep the system current.
    *   Failover mechanisms are in place, so if one service experiences issues, backup systems ensure continuity.

These tools and practices ensure our backend remains healthy, responsive, and secure over time.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, our backend structure is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient. Key points include:

*   A robust architecture built on serverless compute (Cloud Functions and Cloud Run) with centralized API management via API Gateway.
*   A well-structured SQL database using Supabase, with clear schema definitions supporting all aspects of the real estate data.
*   Integrated AI/ML services (Vertex AI, Document AI, Cloud Vision, etc.) that enhance functionality by enabling advanced features such as document analysis and natural language chatbots.
*   Hosting, infrastructure, and security measures using Google Cloud allow us to deliver a high-performance and reliable experience while keeping costs in check.

This comprehensive setup not only meets current project requirements but also lays a strong foundation for future growth and improvements. Every component works harmoniously to ensure that users—whether first-time buyers, seasoned investors, or real estate professionals—experience a secure, fast, and intelligent application.
